    <p>
        In the palace of Mari, in a wing that smelled of cedar smoke and crushed roses, a woman named Tapputi-Bēlat-ekalle ran the royal perfume laboratory.  
        She was not a princess, not a priestess by birth, but rabû – “chief overseer” – of an entire workshop of women who turned plants into power.
    </p>

    <p>
        Her title literally translates as “Lady of the Palace of Chemistry.”  
        She was the first human being in recorded history to sign her name to a chemical process.
    </p>

    <p>
        While most of the world still believed scent was magic breathed by gods, Tapputi built the first still, invented fractional distillation, and wrote precise recipes in sexagesimal fractions we still use for minutes and degrees today.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh fragrant flowers (wild rose or lily)</li>
        <li>Cold-pressed oil (olive or sesame)</li>
        <li>Calamus root (sweet flag)</li>
        <li>Cyperus (nut grass)</li>
        <li>Myrrh resin tears</li>
        <li>Balsam of Gilead</li>

    <h3>Method – The Birth of Distillation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Infuse flowers and reeds into warm oil until the green soul is captured</li>
        <li>Add myrrh and balsam – the resins that bind eternity</li>
        <li>Dilute with water or mild solvent</li>
        <li>Pour into the clay still with reed condenser</li>
        <li>Heat gently → collect vapor → cool → condense</li>
        <li>Filter through linen, then redistill until “the heart of the scent is pure”</li>
        <li>Seal in alabaster</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Erasure</h3>
    <p>
        When empires fell and new ones wrote their own origin stories, they kept the still, kept the fractions, kept the recipes.  
        They simply erased the woman who invented them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Arabs refined her apparatus and called it <i>al-inbiq</i>.  
        The Europeans centuries later called it “alembic” and credited men who were not yet born.  
        Tapputi’s hundreds of tablets were deliberately smashed or buried.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only one shard survived the fire that baked it hard enough to outlast the forgetting.

    They kept the knowledge and erased her name.<br>
